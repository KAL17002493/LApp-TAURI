<h3>Stuff I want to / should add</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pause countdown timer while user is hovering over an item they are currently editing / updating (hard 10 sec counter is not a good way of doing it)</li>
  <li>Marge displayWords() and revertToViewMode() function at least to some degree, currently there is a lot of code overlap between the two</li>
</ul>
