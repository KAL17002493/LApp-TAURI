<h3>Stuff I want to / should add</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pause countdown timer while user is hovering over an item they are currently editing / updating (hard 10 sec counter is not a good way of doing it)</li>
  <li>Merge displayWords() and revertToViewMode() functions at least to some degree, currently there is a lot of code overlap between the two</li>
  <li>Finally figure out where to leave the navigation buttons on permanently</li>
  <li>Make sure that the prevent duplicate words from being displayed feature actually works, testing it with well over 300 words is challanging which is the number of words in db at the time of adding this message</li>
  <li>Check if database has at least 5 words in it before running the recently displayed word check or prevent infinit loop</li>
  <li>When practicing Terrible at instead of getting any word get a batch of like 10 - 20 and cycle between them, this will make it so it's easier to remember them</li>
</ul>

<h3>Done</h3>
<ul>
    <li>English(OK), German(OK), Mix(Ok), New(Ok) : Terrible-At(Ok)</li>
    <li>When user deletes a word clear the search word input field</li>
    <li>Add code to prevent saving duplicate words</li>
</ul>
