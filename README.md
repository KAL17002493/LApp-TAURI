<h3>Stuff I want to / should add</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pause countdown timer while user is hovering over an item they are currently editing / updating (hard 10 sec counter is not a good way of doing it)</li>
  <li>Marge displayWords() and revertToViewMode() functions at least to some degree, currently there is a lot of code overlap between the two</li>
  <li>On practice page if guess field is empy DO NOT load a new word unless a guess is made</li>
  <li>When user deletes a word clear the search word input field</li>
  <li>Finally figure out where to leave the navigation buttons on permanently</li>
  <li>Add code to prevent saving duplicate words</li>
</ul>
